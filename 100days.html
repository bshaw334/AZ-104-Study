<body>
    <h1>This is my #100DaysOfCloud Log</h1>
        <h2>Day 1 - 9/3/2021</h2>
            <p>#Day1 starting off refreshing myself on Linux Bash Scripting through CBT Nuggets.

            Reimaged my Windows 10 laptop to CentOS and created two virtual machines (Ubuntu server and CentOS(no GUI)) using VMware Fusion on my MacBook. Installed Apache to my Ubuntu VM.
            </p>
        <h2>Day 2 - 9/4/2021</h2>
            <p>AZ-104 Study #100DaysOfCloud #Day2 learning about ARM templates with Microsoft Docs and CBT Nuggets, getting ready to throw some infrastructure as a code in VS Code.</p>
        <h2>Day 3 - 17 - 9/5- 9/17/2021</h2>
            <p>Researched several job announcements, DevOps, System Engineers, Systems Administrator, Cloud Engineer roles to see what was being the most requested skills. From my research AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Python, Bash, Git, CI/CD experience, and RHEL experience were the common threads. 
                
            With this new knowledge, I have shifted my focus to AWS and being more consistent with using Git from the command line while also tracking my progress through this log. 
        
            Spent most of these days Going through the CBT Nuggets AWS Cloud Practitioner modules. It's Friday the 17th, I'm on video 21/151. Current topic is on Management interfaces at AWS.
