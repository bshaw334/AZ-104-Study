    <title>100 Days of Cloud - Log</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is my #100DaysOfCloud Log</h1>
        <h2>Day 1 - 9/3/2021</h2>
            <p>#Day1 starting off refreshing myself on Linux Bash Scripting through CBT Nuggets.

            Reimaged my Windows 10 laptop to CentOS and created two virtual machines (Ubuntu server and CentOS(no GUI)) using VMware Fusion on my MacBook. Installed Apache to my Ubuntu VM.
            </p>
        <h2>Day 2 - 9/4/2021</h2>
            <p>AZ-104 Study #100DaysOfCloud #Day2 learning about ARM templates with Microsoft Docs and CBT Nuggets, getting ready to throw some infrastructure as a code in VS Code.</p>
        <h2>Day 3 - 17 | 9/5- 9/17/2021</h2>
            <p>Researched several job announcements, DevOps, System Engineers, Systems Administrator, Cloud Engineer roles to see what was being the most requested skills. From my research AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Python, Bash, Git, CI/CD experience, and RHEL experience were the common threads. 
                
            With this new knowledge, I have shifted my focus to AWS and being more consistent with using Git from the command line while also tracking my progress through this log. 
        
            Spent most of these days Going through the CBT Nuggets AWS Cloud Practitioner modules. It's Friday the 17th, I'm on video 21/151. Current topic is on Management interfaces at AWS. </p>
        <h2>Day 18 - 27 | 9/18 - 10/4/2021</h2>
            <p>After studying AWS for about a week I realized that the terminology learning curve on top of trying to still complete my AZ-104 by the end of November would be too drastic of a change. I shift back to Azure then decided to devote 5 days to studying, taking, and passing the MS-900 Microsoft 365 Fundamentals. Taking that exam did a few things for me, it allowed me to validate that my study methods seem to be working. 
                <ol>
                    <li>Deep Dive reading into the topic, learning terms, definitions, and concepts.</li>
                    <li>Taking online modules to hear the same material delivered in a different form.</li>
                    <li>Watching cram session videos on the cert to hear everything broken down into bite sized chunks.</li>
                    <li>Taking practice exams by section, starting with the highest weighted and working my way down with refresher reading and studying.</li>
                    <li>Passing practice exams with at or above 80%.</li>
                </ol>
            I am currently studying for the SC-900 Microsoft Certified: Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals. Both the MS-900 and SC-900 touch on Azure AD and Compliance which will help with the AZ-104. Currently on study method 1, using the Microsoft Learn modules to do the deep dive reading. Next I'll go through a few related courses on A Cloud Guru and CBT Nuggets since there are no real dedicated online modules for the cert yet. Until then, catch me in the cloud. 
            </p>

        <h2>Day 28 - 36 | 10/4 - 10/13/2021</h2>
            <p>On Monday the 11th I passed the SC-900! Went through the whole study methodology and now completely focusing on AZ-104. After many recommendations and researach I decided to start using A Cloud Guru as an additional learning research, mainly because of the sandboxes they provide for the 3 big cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). I'm currently on the Azure Architecture path which starts off with AZ-900 modules, then moves into Az-104. This morning I went through chapters 1-3 of the Azure Administrator course.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Chapter 1 - Intros, Prep for Exam, and Readiness Quiz made a 76/80% passing.</li>
                <li>Chapter 2 - Supplementary Courses intros for Storage and IAM - I'll double back to those.</li>
                <li>Chapter 3 - Azure Administration - Good refreshers on the portal, resources, CLI & Powershell, and ARM templates.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Labs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <lI>Create custom console url.</lI>
                    <li>Log into AWS from VSCode with access keys. </li>
                </ul>
