    <h1>PowerShell</h1>
        <p>A few things I've picked up over my studying for AZ-104 and more.</p>
    <h2>Creating Variables</h2>
    <p>Variables will make scripting simplified by taking known information and simplifying how it is presented to the script </p>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>Below I created a variable named $rg to pull in the name of a single resource group. This step can also be performed by typing/pasting a static resource group name.</p>
    <pre><code>rg$ = (Get-AzResourceGroup).ResourceGroupName</code></pre>
    <p>Below I created a variable named $RG to query the resource group list and list them in tab seperated value (tsv).</p>
    <pre><code>RG$ = az group list --query [].name -o tsv</code></pre>
